# CS-student-Challenges_Java
As a CS student I want to do some self guided challenges to keep my skills sharp!                                                                                                  
I love coding and so these challenges will go right the way up to the start of year two ,                                                             
they will not be simple "write code to show I can make a variable" type stuff!

Challenges:
1. Make a primitive Blockchain (User can input transactions into a block then a pre set private key signs off the transactions and is checked with the pre set public key and the blocks are stored in an Arraylist and have both their own and the previous hash value aswell as requiring the current hash value having 20 0's at the begining)
